# text-summarizer

I wrote the code for this text summarizer a little while ago.

Sorry for the bad (nonexistent) comments(but code is kinda selfexplanetory).

However, it works quite well :)

# Usage

    python3 textinput.py

just put the directory of your textfile here in the textinput.py file.

`text = io.open('directory of your textfile', 'r', encoding='utf-8').read() `

Feel free to add comments to the code if you like and do a pr.
